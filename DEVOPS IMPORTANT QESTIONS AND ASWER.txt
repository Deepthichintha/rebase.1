5. What is Process Scheduling?
Answer:
Process Scheduling is the mechanism used by the OS to manage the execution of multiple processes efficiently.

Types of Scheduling:

Long-Term Scheduling – Decides which processes enter the system.
Short-Term Scheduling – Decides which process executes next.
Medium-Term Scheduling – Swaps processes in and out of memory.
6. What is a Deadlock?
Answer:
A Deadlock occurs when two or more processes are waiting for each other to release resources, preventing further execution.

Example:
Process A holds Resource 1 and waits for Resource 2, while Process B holds Resource 2 and waits for Resource 1 → Deadlock!

7. What are the necessary conditions for Deadlock?
Answer: Deadlock occurs if these four conditions hold simultaneously:

Mutual Exclusion – Only one process can use a resource at a time.
Hold and Wait – A process holding a resource is waiting for another resource.
No Preemption – Resources cannot be forcibly taken away.
Circular Wait – A cycle of processes waiting for resources.
8. How to prevent or handle Deadlocks?
Answer:

Deadlock Prevention: Ensure that at least one of the four deadlock conditions does not hold.
Deadlock Avoidance: Use algorithms like Banker’s Algorithm.
Deadlock Detection: Detect cycles in the system’s resource allocation graph.
Deadlock Recovery: Kill a process or preempt a resource.
9. What is Virtual Memory?
Answer:
Virtual memory is a technique that allows a process to use more memory than is physically available by storing part of the memory on the hard disk (swap space).

Benefits:

Allows running large programs.
Provides memory isolation for processes.
Example: Paging and Segmentation.

10. What is Paging?
Answer:
Paging is a memory management technique where memory is divided into fixed-size blocks (pages). It helps in efficient memory utilization.

Example:

A process of 8KB is divided into 2 pages (if page size = 4KB).
These pages are stored in different frames in RAM.
Advantage: Reduces external fragmentation.

11. What is Swapping in OS?
Answer:
Swapping is a memory management technique where processes are temporarily moved to disk to free up RAM and then swapped back when needed.

Example:

When RAM is full, inactive processes are swapped to the hard disk.
Disadvantage: Slower performance due to disk I/O.

12. What is Fragmentation in OS?
Answer:
Fragmentation occurs when memory is inefficiently allocated, leading to wasted space.

Types:

Internal Fragmentation – Wasted space inside allocated memory.
External Fragmentation – Free memory is available but not contiguous.
Solution: Use paging or memory compaction.

13. What is Thrashing in OS?
Answer:
Thrashing occurs when the system spends more time swapping processes in and out of memory than executing them.

Causes:

Too many processes.
Insufficient RAM.
Solution:

Increase RAM.
Use working set model to limit active processes.
