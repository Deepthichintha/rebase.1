user management:

we have two types of users they are:
 1.noramal user
 2.root user

in user management if we want to add a user we can give the command 
      adduser: it will create a user along with password. and respected directory will be created.
      useradd: it will create a user without a password. and it wont't create the directory aswell
               if we want to give password to a user created by the command useradd
                      enter : passwd username
                      it will create the password for the user.
ls -l : it will show weather the created users files or a directory
how can we check?
 if the line starts with
-.......it means its a file
d.......it means its a directory
l.......it means its a link
     after creating the username we have to go to the home by command
        cd /home
   so that we can check weather the directory is created or not .

after that 
                   uid=1006(surya) gid=1012(anil1) groups=1012(anil1),100(users),1004(doom1)
              1. user id (user owner)
              2. group id (group owner)
              3. groups
  if we wants to create a groupname 
we can give the command groupadd groupname.
               if we wants to add the group 
             we have the command 
                     usermod -aG groupname username
         if we wants to change the groupid name 
                     usermod -g groupname username
         if wants to change the userid name 
                     usermod -l newusername username
